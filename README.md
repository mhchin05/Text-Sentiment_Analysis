# Text Analytics and Sentiment Analysis System

This project leverages text analytics and sentiment analysis techniques to classify and analyze social media content, focusing on detecting cyberbullying. Using a dataset of 47,000 tweets categorized into different types of cyberbullying, this system employs supervised machine learning models to effectively classify text data.

## Key Features:
- Data Processing: Tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming to clean and prepare text for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and insights to understand class distributions and term frequencies.
- Supervised Classification Models: Implements Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Multinomial Naïve Bayes models, optimized via hyperparameter tuning.
- Performance Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics evaluate the model’s effectiveness in classifying cyberbullying content.
